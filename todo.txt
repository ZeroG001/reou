The dream. Is to make Real Estate One "THE" place to get your state license. Create an engaging UI that will attract users to the classes. Easy-to-use statistics for admins to create and manage schedules. Auto-payment system to esentially phase out the jobs of the people.

// I was just about to log in as a user and see all the variables availible to be.
// The Model controller and views are already sort of set up.
// In Each file I have a string called "removeme". The lines below this are the ones you're going to want to remove.
